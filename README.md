# Calculator-Game

I created a GUI calculator game in Python utilizing the library tkinter. The game works by creating unique random problems to show to the player for them to answer. Users can create questions specific to addition, multiplication, division, subtraction, or a random problem. The game will keep track of your stats and return them at the end of the game.

Below are photos demonstrating the game:
